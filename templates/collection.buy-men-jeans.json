Make sure you check first that the vinegar is safe for use in your washing machine. And <strong>never</strong> use fabric softener.</li><li><strong>Air dry: </strong>Dry your jeans on a line rather than in the tumble dryer to prevent shrinkage and to save energy.</li><li><strong>Hand wash:</strong> Wash your jeans in a bucket of lukewarm water. This is the gentlest method.</li></ul><h2><strong><br/>Mix and match sustainable denim into a stylish, timeless outfit</strong></h2><p>Timeless men's jeans are the perfect foundation for any look.
