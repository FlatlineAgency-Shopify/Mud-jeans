Until you decide to send them back to us for recycling.<\/p>"}},"question_xR9dgG":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What makes leasing different from buying?","answer":"<p>Simply put: leasing means paying a small monthly fee over the course of one year instead of a larger amount all in one go. For us, this is a fantastic way to ensure we get back our raw materials once your jeans are worn out, in order to create new jeans out of them. The financial incentive for you: your following leases will be cheaper. You will get a 10% discount on your next lease that both you, your family and your friends can also enjoy!<\/p>"}},"question_eQqReM":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Can I change the jeans throughout the lease?","answer":"<p>No, you have to lease the jeans for a consecutive 12 month-period. After that, the payments stop and you can keep the jeans for as long as you'd like (the longer, the better for our planet). However, you can decide to lease a 2nd or 3rd pair of jeans during or at the end of your first lease at a 10% discount! If you want to do this at the end of your leasing period, you can swap your jeans for a new pair and start the leasing process over again.<\/p>"}},"question_DpVgpH":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What is a family discount?","answer":"<p>Once you have become a member of our leasing MUD fam', we would love for you to spread the circular word. So, your family members and friends have a special offer... They can start leasing a pair of jeans on your account at a 10% monthly discount! <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["question_k6gWYp","question_xR9dgG","question_eQqReM","question_DpVgpH"],"settings":{"title":"Find all your answers here!"}},"newsletter_FBM6QL":{"type":"newsletter","settings":{"title":"Subscribe to our newsletter","subheading":"<p>Be the first to get exclusive deals, new denim drops, and latest circular fashion insights—straight to your inbox.<\/p>","color_scheme":"default"}}},"order":["main","image_with_text_overlay_86N4FX","rich_text_zYL8Ab","image_with_text_overlay_6MfELT","rich_text_FXA9pF","image_with_text_overlay_RRMpET","key_features_GtdUeb","rich_text_LMPKPU","image_with_text_overlay_NGtkdn","video_w6QpFc","testimonials_9HHtfz","rich_text_VcimYj","gallery_U9bkYz","collapsible_tabs_ABLTdJ","newsletter_FBM6QL"]}
