This includes carcinogens and hormone disruptors. These chemicals harm the environment and biodiversity, but also the people that must come in contact with them.<\/p><p>However, not all chemistry is bad chemistry. Everything is made of chemicals; this includes the skin on your body and the coffee you are drinking. The key is in responsibly selecting the chemicals used. MUD Jeans consciously ensures that no toxic chemicals are used in the making of our denim. Between 2018 and 2020 all MUD products have been certified by the Nordic Swan Ecolabel. This certificate reviews all items and procedures and confirms that we only use non-harmful, biodegradable chemicals. In 2021, we have implemented a new and improved chemical policy based on ZDHC guidelines. ZDHC stands for Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals - something we want to stand by. And we are extremely proud that all of our supply chain partners are compliant with this approach.<\/p><p>MUD Jeans is also unique for the elimination of PP spray and pumice stone washing from the production process. Instead, we use innovative techniques such as laser, ozone and so-called “eco stones” to achieve similar effects. These techniques are not only better for the environment, but also for the health of our colleagues that work at the factories and make our jeans.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}}},"block_order":["heading_8iTqUM","text_e3yz6H"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Returns-Repairs-3.jpg","image_width":700,"image_link":"","image_position":"right","text_alignment":"left","color_scheme":"default"}},"rich_text_EhX99X":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"text_ByJANt":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><strong>Additional Resources<\/strong><\/p><p>Videos:<\/p><ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/cleanclothes.org\/unclear-supply-chains\">Clean Clothes Campaign<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GlIItSKHp1g\">Who made my clothes?<\/a><\/li><\/ol><p>Reading:<\/p><ol><li><a href=\"https:\/\/sourcingjournal.com\/topics\/thought-leadership\/logility-supply-chain-transparency-greenwashing-xinjiang-forced-labor-customs-293815\/\">Transparency and Greenwashing<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/goodonyou.eco\/transparency-fashion-industry\/\">Transparency in fashion<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/remake.world\/stories\/style\/who-made-your-clothes-transparency-is-the-first-step-in-creating-a-sustainable-fashion-industry\/\">Transparency as a tool towards sustainable fashion<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fashionrevolution.org\/about\/transparency\/\">Fashion Transparency Index<\/a><\/li><\/ol>","enlarge_text":true}}},"block_order":["text_ByJANt"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":true,"color_scheme":"1"}},"image_with_text_overlay_PbMc4A":{"type":"image-with-text-overlay","blocks":{"button_gMNy3R":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Take Quiz","button_link":"https:\/\/ambassador.mudjeans.eu\/student\/app\/t\/1kf?_gl=1*9ftkof*_ga*MTQ1MzAxMDY4MS4xNzA5NzM5MTI3*_ga_5P62G1X8ZT*MTcxMTEwODU5My4xMjAuMS4xNzExMTE0OTI1LjUzLjAuMA..","button_style":"secondary"}},"button_PXXNqm":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Go to Class 5","button_link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/class-5-mud-jeans","button_style":"secondary"}}},"block_order":["button_gMNy3R","button_PXXNqm"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screenshot_2024-03-13_at_15.42.21.png","height":"adapt","height_desktop":600,"height_mobile":460,"image_link":"","full_width":true,"text_alignment":"bottom right","mobile_overlay_under":false,"overlay_style":"shadow"}},"newsletter_X8KA3J":{"type":"newsletter","settings":{"title":"Subscribe to our newsletter","subheading":"<p>Promotions, new products and sales.
